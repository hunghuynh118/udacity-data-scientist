# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run your web app: `python run.py`

4. Click the `PREVIEW` button to open the homepage

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I apply data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from [Appen](https://appen.com/) (formally Figure 8) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

The data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. I created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that I can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

I also created a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also display visualizations of the data.
