# Udacity Data Scientist

### by Hung Huynh

This is the repository where I save my work while studying Udacity Data Scientist course.

## Project 1: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post

In this project, I decided to analyse the Used Cars dataset found on Kaggle using the CRISP-DM process. I also try predicting price of used cars using machine learning model. Then I communicate my findings via a Medium blog post.
