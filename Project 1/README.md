## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using used cars dataset from Kaggle to better understand:

1. What factors affect the price of a used car?
2. Which brands have most used cars?
3. Should we choose an automatic or manual car?

I wanted the chance to investigate the data and also communicate my findings in a blog post on Medium, which I think will be interesting and help the reader understand the concerns given.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook available here to showcase my work related to the above questions. The notebook contains code, comments, and markdown cells to guild reader through the process.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hunghuynh.11899/what-to-consider-while-buying-an-used-car-c05c47d643d8).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncovering-factors-that-affect-used-car-prices). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
